    "R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure used in linear regression models to assess the goodness of fit. It provides information about the proportion of the dependent variable's variance that is explained by the independent variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand R-squared, let's first define some key terms in linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependent variable: This is the variable you are trying to predict or explain. It is also known as the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent variables: These are the variables used to predict or explain the dependent variable. They are also called predictor variables or features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear regression, the model tries to estimate the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables by fitting a line (in simple linear regression) or a hyperplane (in multiple linear regression) to the data. R-squared quantifies how well this line or hyperplane represents the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1. A value of 0 means that the independent variables have no explanatory power and fail to predict the dependent variable. On the other hand, an R-squared value of 1 indicates that the independent variables perfectly explain the variation in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared = 1 - (SSR / SST)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "SSR (Sum of Squared Residuals) is the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable.\n",
    "SST (Total Sum of Squares) is the sum of the squared differences between the actual values of the dependent variable and the mean of the dependent variable.\n",
    "In simpler terms, R-squared is the proportion of the total variation in the dependent variable that is captured by the regression model. It represents the percentage of the dependent variable's variance that can be explained by the independent variables. For example, an R-squared value of 0.75 means that 75% of the variation in the dependent variable can be accounted for by the independent variables"

As additional variables are added to a model, the adjusted R-squared value will only increase if the new variable significantly improves the model's explanatory power. This penalty discourages overfitting, where a model appears to fit the data well but may not generalize well to new data.\n",

When comparing models with a different number of variables, regular R-squared can be misleading because it tends to increase even if irrelevant variables are added.

    "Model Comparison: Adjusted R-squared allows for fair comparisons between models with different numbers of independent variables. When comparing multiple models, each with a varying number of predictors, using regular R-squared alone can be misleading.

    "Multicollinearity: Adjusted R-squared is particularly useful when dealing with multicollinearity, a situation where independent variables are highly correlated with each other. In such cases, regular R-squared tends to overestimate the model's explanatory power because it does not account for the redundancy in the predictors. Adjusted R-squared adjusts for the number of variables, mitigating the impact of multicollinearity on the goodness of fit assessmen"

    "RMSE, MSE, and MAE are common metrics used to evaluate the performance of regression models by measuring the accuracy of the predicted values compared to the actual values. Here's an explanation of each metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): RMSE is a measure of the average magnitude of the residuals or prediction errors in a regression model. It represents the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values. RMSE is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE = sqrt(MSE) = sqrt(1/n * sum((Yi - 킷i)^2))\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "n is the number of observations.\n",
    "Yi represents the actual values of the dependent variable.\n",
    "킷i represents the predicted values of the dependent variable.\n",
    "RMSE is commonly used because it allows for easy interpretation and is on the same scale as the dependent variable. Smaller RMSE values indicate better model performance, as they represent a smaller average difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE): MSE is another measure of the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values. It is calculated by averaging the squared residuals across all observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE = 1/n * sum((Yi - 킷i)^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE provides a measure of the average prediction error, without taking the square root. It is useful for comparing the overall performance of different models. However, it lacks interpretability since it is not in the original scale of the dependent variable.\n",

    "MAE = 1/n * sum(|Yi - 킷i|)\n",

    "RMSE, MSE, and MAE are widely used evaluation metrics in regression analysis, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Let's discuss them in more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of RMSE, MSE, and MAE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly Used: RMSE, MSE, and MAE are well-established and commonly used metrics in regression analysis. They provide standardized measures of prediction accuracy, allowing for easy comparison between models and across studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy Interpretation: RMSE and MAE are on the same scale as the dependent variable, making them interpretable in the context of the problem. They represent the average prediction error in the original units of the variable, allowing for intuitive understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to Large Errors: RMSE and MSE are particularly sensitive to large errors because they square the residuals. This means that models with outliers or significant deviations from the actual values will have larger RMSE and MSE values, reflecting the impact of those errors on the overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of RMSE, MSE, and MAE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of Robustness to Outliers: While the sensitivity of RMSE and MSE to outliers can be an advantage, it can also be a disadvantage. Outliers can disproportionately affect these metrics, leading to inflated error values and potentially misleading interpretations. MAE is less sensitive to outliers but can still be influenced by extreme errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency on Scale: RMSE and MSE are influenced by the scale of the dependent variable since they involve squaring the errors. This means that models with larger dependent variable values may have larger RMSE and MSE values, even if the prediction error is similar in magnitude. MAE, being based on absolute differences, is not affected by the scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability of Magnitude: While RMSE, MSE, and MAE provide measures of prediction error, they do not inherently indicate what level of error is acceptable or satisfactory. Interpretation of the magnitude of these metrics depends on the specific context, problem domain, and the variability of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different Optimization Objectives: It's worth noting that RMSE, MSE, and MAE have different optimization objectives. Minimizing RMSE or MSE corresponds to minimizing the squared errors, which places more emphasis on large errors. Minimizing MAE focuses on minimizing the absolute errors, giving equal weight to all errors regardless of their magnitude."

The chosen values of 0.1 and 0.5 for the regularization parameters may or may not be appropriate depending on the data and problem at hand.\n",
    "If the true underlying model is sparse, Lasso regularization may outperform Ridge regularization as it can eliminate irrelevant features. However, if all the features are relevant, Ridge regularization may provide better results.\n",

Proper evaluation and understanding of the trade-offs and limitations of each regularization method are necessary for making an informed decision.\n",
